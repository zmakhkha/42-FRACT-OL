Subject: Application for Technical Staff Position at 1337 Khouribga

Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is MAKHKHAS Zakaria and I am writing to express my interest in the Technical Staff position at 1337 Khouribga. I came across this opportunity on 1337 Khouribga and I believe that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for the role.

I have six months of experience in the education field and hold a Bac +5 diploma in Security of Systems and Services. During my studies, I reinforced my skills in Java, especially JEE, artificial intelligence, mathematics, Linux system administration, and mobile development using Java. I went deep into short path algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning, and to graduate, I built a deep learning-based algorithm based on Chebyshev polynomials that aimed to reproduce a mathematical representation of a large dimension image using a low-definition matrix. This matrix was used to feed a dense net architecture that reached an accuracy of 95.58 on the Faces 95 dataset, 98.04 on the Faces 96 dataset, and 93.21 on the FEI dataset, using 50% for training and 50% for testing.

Additionally, for the past 6 months, I have been working as a teacher of informatique for college students, where I have honed my skills in explaining technical concepts in a way that is accessible to a wide range of learners.

I am confident that my educational background, hands-on experience, and teaching skills make me a valuable asset to your team. I am eager to bring my technical skills and passion for technology to the Technical Staff position and help contribute to the school's continued success.

Attached to this email, you will find my resume and a cover letter that provides additional information about my qualifications. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss my application further in an interview. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

MAKHKHAS Zakaria
